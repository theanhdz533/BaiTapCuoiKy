            <div class="content_mid">
                <p>Tokyo's Shibuya district is one of the liveliest places on the planet. Day or night, it's generally densely packed with people and positively thrumming with energy. Ghostwire: Tokyo shows us another side of this iconic urban hub, after a supernatural force leaves its streets eerily deserted. It's a nightmarish vision, but an absolutely incredible recreation nonetheless – this city slice feels astonishingly like the real thing (albeit with more conspicuous shrines), and the game's dedication to its setting is paired with an equal level of zeal for embracing Japanese folklore and tradition. The catch, however, is that it’s let down by bland mission design and one-dimensional combat, making it a lot less fun to actually play than it is to enjoy as a virtual tourist.

                   <br> <br> Ghostwire: Tokyo has not one, but two protagonists. Akito is the lone corporeal survivor of the mysterious fog that turned Shibuya into a literal ghosttown and was in a bad place even before the spirits hit the fan. His sister in a nearby hospital, he’s desperate to discover what’s become of her, but now finds himself in an uneasy alliance with KK, a surly spirit out to settle a score with the Hannya mask-wearing madman responsible for the attack. This "uneasy alliance" by the way, means literally fighting for control over the one body. Their initial angry clashes soon give way to a shared goal and growing understanding, and while I didn’t find either character hugely relatable, their family-focused backstories helped ground the grandiose main plot. Plus, with KK along for the ride, Akito gains a host of supernatural powers, all the better to deal with the many unsettling Visitors lurking on the streets.</p>

                <p>Working towards discovering what’s actually going on will feel extremely familiar to anyone who's played an open-world game since Assassin's Creed. In this instance, the map starts out almost entirely cloaked in toxic fog, and it's only by cleansing torii gates across it that new areas of the city become accessible.

                <br> <br>    It's not actually such a bad thing that this open world starts out closed for business. Ghostwire: Tokyo is incredibly dense, so steadily working through new sections of the city to reach and purify gates meant that I got to appreciate every side of this game world, and it feels like there are hundreds of them.
                    
                <br> <br>    Tokyo, after all, is a city of contrasts: between the glitz of modernity and the quiet reflection of tradition, between the intensity of its concrete jungle and the pockets of greenery that provide an escape, between tourist hotspots and forgotten tenements, and between towering shopping complexes and dingy back alleys packed with tiny bars. These aspects of the city are perfectly captured by Ghostwire's sprawling map and incredible attention to detail, making it feel like a truly believable place... albeit one trapped within a perpetual night, where even the regular downpours can't wash away the reminders that hundreds of thousands of people suddenly and inexplicably vanished. There are piles of clothes everywhere, trapped spirits floating in the air and ghosts with unfinished business to help.</p>
